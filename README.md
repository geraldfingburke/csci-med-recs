# CSCI Medical Records
-----------------------
A medical records dummy site for penetration and security testing

## The Purpose

In August of 2023, I was asked to step into a teaching position at Northeast State Community College about a week before the start of the semester.

The assignment was intended for someone with experience in networking and cyber, two major blindspots for me.

One of the classes I was to pick up was a Firewalls and Internet Security course.

After an extensive reading and interpretation of the catalog entry for the course, I figured that I could leverage my knowlege of web application development to teach these students web-based penetration testing.

While there are many great resources for learning these techniques, I found myself needing a web application with vulnerabilities the students could test their new tools against.

That's where this project was born.

This site is a willfully broken medical records portal full of easter eggs, dummy data, and simplified exploits.

I basically took the OWASP Top Ten and used them as a blueprint for making an emminently exploitable service.

## The Stack

Having to self-host this bad boy, I went with a stack that was cheap, easy, and vulnerable.

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

LAMP on the backend because everything free is linux and PHP is easy to break.

## The Site
